| 2025-04-26 | Since removing Bootstrap's `padding-right` the modal jumps/moves glitchily on small screens when opening | JavaScript Bootstrap | Initialize Win95 modal manually with `scroll: true` to prevent Bootstrap from injecting/removing `padding-right` and causing the layout reflow. |

2025-04-26 | Update HTML logic to no longer manually insert modal | HTML | Confirmed that modal is now injected dynamically through JavaScript on shuffle button click. No manual modal HTML needed inside onecard.html or threecard.html.

2025-04-26 | Sound Effects for Learning Game | JS + Assets | Added "Windows 95 error" sound effect on incorrect answers during the Learn card game (learn.js). Created an Audio object for win95_error.mp3 and triggered play on wrong selections only.

2025-04-26 | Landing Page Enter key redirect not working during animation | JS | Refactored event listeners to ensure pressing Enter at any time (including mid-animation) redirects user instantly to info.html. Used a helper function for clean consistent behavior.
2025-04-26 | Accordion opening caused background zoom/stretch | CSS | Fixed background behavior by applying background-size: cover, background-attachment: fixed, and setting html, body to 100% height. Accordion content can expand without distorting the background. Background remains clean and consistent across viewport sizes. 
Date | Bug | Focus | Solution
2025-04-26 | Typing animation welcome message was not properly capitalized | JS (info.js) | Updated startTyping() so that "Welcome seeker..." appears correctly with a capital "W", improving tone and polish.

2025-04-26 | Cards would not flip properly on mobile devices (only hovered on desktop) | JS (cards.js) | Added touch detection and event listener to manually toggle .flipped class on card tap for touch devices, enabling flip behavior on phones and tablets.
2025-04-26 | Cards on mobile would flip once but not flip back | JS/CSS | Refined toggle logic inside enableTouchFlipBehavior(), ensuring a second tap would remove .flipped class and return the card to front view.
2025-04-26 | Flip card CSS rules conflicted between hover and click-based flipping | CSS | Modified .flip-card-inner and .flip-card-back transitions to harmonize hover flips (desktop) and tap flips (mobile) without animation glitches.
2025-04-27 | Suit introduction paragraphs disappeared after dynamic card rendering | JS (cards.js) | Moved insertSuitIntro() calls after card generation to prevent DOM overwrites; ensured suit intros persist and display properly.
2025-04-27 | Suit introduction text was centered instead of justified | CSS | Added .suit-intro { text-align: justify; padding: 1rem; } to style long introductory paragraphs with better readability.
2025-04-27 | Flip card hover and tap conflicts broke on mixed device interactions | JS | Further refined hover/tap separation so hover only applies to non-touch devices, preserving intuitive behavior across all device types.
2025-04-27 | Missing accessible labels for tarot cards in gallery | HTML/JS | Ensured all flip-cards have aria-labelledby attributes linked to hidden <h3> titles inside back side of card, improving screen reader support.
Date | Bug / Update | Focus Area | Fix Notes
2025-04-27 | Tarot Readings dynamic heading was not resizing correctly across viewports. | Info page JS | Added dynamic font resizing for the readings heading.

2025-04-27 | Oracle misinterpreted user birthdays due to US-centric date assumptions. | Oracle frontend & backend | Added locale detection using navigator.language on the frontend and passed it to the backend. Implemented birthday normalization based on user locale: DD-MM for Europe, MM-DD for US/Canada, and handling YYYY-MM-DD for Japan. Adjusted fallback parsing to prefer DD-MM format. Confirmed Oracle now interprets birthdays correctly across different regions.
2025-04-27 | Draw button remained active during card flip animation. | One Card page (JS) | Disabled the draw button during card flip animation and card details display. Added an extra 1 second delay before re-enabling to ensure smooth UX and prevent multiple rapid draws.
2025-04-27 | Cardback images on info page appeared abruptly without smooth transition. | Info Page CSS | Fixed the visibility animation by removing display: none and controlling visibility via opacity transitions.
